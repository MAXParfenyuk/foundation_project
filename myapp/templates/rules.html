      <h2>Game Rules:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Each player is dealt two cards.</li>
        <li>Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).</li>
        <li>The goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.</li>
        <li>Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points. Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points.</li>
        <li>If a player's hand exceeds 21 points, they lose the game.</li>
        <li>If both the player and the dealer have the same hand value, the game is a push and the player's bet is returned.</li>
        <li>If a player wins, they receive their bet back plus an amount equal to their bet. If the player has a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card), they win 1.5 times their bet.</li>
      </ol>
